# Fitness Tracker

This is a simple fitness tracker made using Mongo and Express. 

## User Story

AS A user
I WANT to be able to have a flexible tracker
SO THAT I can view, create, and track daily workouts.


## Business Context
A consumer will reach their fitness goals quicker when they track their workout progress.

## Planner works as follows:

* When the user loads the page, they have the option to create a new workout, or continue with their last workout.

* Once a selection is made, the user can then:
    - Add exercises to a previous workout plan
    - Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

<!-- * Refer to GIF below for an app demo.
